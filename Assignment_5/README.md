# Errors and Other Notes

* NOTE: I run my program by doing "./a.out ./output FILENAME", so whatever the third command line argument is the source code file I use in the program so please run it the same way if you can.
* No runtime errors.
* I was able to figure out how to pinpoint where delimiter syntax errors would occur in a sample source code, but I could not figure out the overall logic of if it was a wrong closed symbol or where to pinpoint the exact location of a closed curly brace. So I'm sure there are going to be cases where my program will not detect errors correctly.
* I'd like to use the three late days if those are available.
