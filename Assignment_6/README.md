# Errors and Other Notes

* NOTE: I run my program by doing "./a.out FILENAME", so whatever the second command line argument is the input file I use in the program so please run it the same way if you can.
* No runtime errors.
* Some metrics are wrong. Couldn't figure out how to get them all correct, I believe it's something in my while loop when
running the simulation. For example my waiting times are always +1 longer than they should actually be, and my idle times
are just not correct. Everything else involved in the assignment I believe works correctly.
* Received extension.
